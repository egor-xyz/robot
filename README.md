# robot 🤖

### A little robot lives above your Claude Code prompt. It walks, dances, and goes fishing while Claude works.

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) mod with an ASCII robot mascot.
It walks the full width of the band above your prompt, blinks, waves, naps under
the moon, shoots hoops, goes fishing, plants a garden and gets abducted by a UFO.

## 🚀 Install in Claude Code

Type these two lines in the Claude Code prompt — that's it:

```text
/plugin marketplace add egor-xyz/robot
/plugin install robot@robot
```

Restart Claude Code and the robot appears above the prompt.

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install</summary>

**From your shell** — one line:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add egor-xyz/robot && claude plugin install robot@robot
```

**Or just ask Claude:** _"install the robot plugin from egor-xyz/robot"_.

</details>

You only need `zsh` — it's already there on macOS.

## ✨ What it does

- 🤖 **20+ hand-drawn animations.** Walk, dance, jump, sleep, campfire, garden, concert, photoshoot…
- ↔️ **Full width.** The robot walks from edge to edge and follows you when you resize the window.
- 🎨 **Colour per mood.** Each animation has its own colour; dance and jump cycle a rainbow.
- 🙈 **Out of the way.** `/robot` hides it; it steps aside by itself when Claude asks you something.
- 🪶 **Tiny.** No daemon, no network, no dependencies beyond `zsh`.

## 🎮 Use it

| Command  | Action                 |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| `/robot` | Hide or show the robot |

### Update or remove

```text
/plugin marketplace update robot     # fetch the newest robot
/plugin update robot@robot           # switch to it
/plugin uninstall robot@robot        # remove it
```

## 🔧 How it works

A Claude Code mod is a small plugin that can draw inside Claude Code. This one
lives in [`claude-mod/`](claude-mod/):

1. When Claude Code starts, the mod runs this repo's own
   [`functions/crazy-robot`](functions/crazy-robot) in `zsh` once and records
   1200 frames sized to your window.
2. It plays them on a loop, 4 frames a second, in the band above the prompt.
3. When you resize the window, it records new frames for the new width.

Because it reuses `crazy-robot` as is, every new animation in the repo shows up
in Claude Code with no change to the mod.

## 🖥️ Bonus: the robot in your terminal

The same robot also runs as a full-screen terminal toy, in the spirit of
[`cmatrix`](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) and `sl` — with a
slot-machine easter egg. 🎰

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egor-xyz/robot/main/install.sh | bash
robot
```

Re-run the install line later to update — it pins your local copy to the latest
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/egor-xyz/robot/releases) tag.

| Key         | Action                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `↑` / `↓`   | Cycle animations (also `k` / `j`) |
| `→`         | Open settings                     |
| `←`         | Back to the robot (from settings) |
| `Space`     | 🎰 Slot machine                   |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit                              |

<details>
<summary><b>Install with a zsh plugin manager</b></summary>

**antidote / antibody**

```zsh
antidote bundle egor-xyz/robot
```

**zinit**

```zsh
zinit light egor-xyz/robot
```

**sheldon** — `~/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml`:

```toml
[plugins.robot]
github = "egor-xyz/robot"
```

**oh-my-zsh** (custom plugin)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/egor-xyz/robot.git \
  ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/robot
```

Then add `robot` to your `plugins=(...)` line.

**Manual**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/egor-xyz/robot.git ~/.robot
echo 'source ~/.robot/robot.plugin.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Terminal settings</b></summary>

Open the settings panel with `→`, or set the variable in `~/.zshrc` before
sourcing the plugin.

| Variable            | Default | Effect                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ROBOT_TIPS`        | `1`     | `0` hides the hint line under the robot for a cleaner screensaver.                                                    |
| `ROBOT_AUTO_UPDATE` | `0`     | `1` fetches tags and checks out the latest GitHub Release in the background, once per launch. Visible on next launch. |

Settings toggled in the panel persist to `~/.config/robot/settings`. The
terminal toy needs `zsh` ≥ 5.0, plus `git` + `curl` only for the optional
self-update.

## 📦 Versioning

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and are derived from
the closest tag. The installer and the in-shell updater pin to the latest
published [GitHub Release](https://github.com/egor-xyz/robot/releases) — never
the tip of `main`. Releases are cut automatically by `semantic-release` from
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) PR titles.
